The Spam Collecte dataset is a dataset used for spam email detection. It consists of examples of emails classified as either spam or non-spam.

Here is a general description of the Spam Collecte dataset:

Number of samples: The dataset contains a set of individual emails, with each email being a separate example. The total number of samples may vary depending on the specific version of the dataset you are using.

Variables/Features: Each email is associated with multiple variables/features that can be used to predict whether it is spam or non-spam. These variables may include information such as the sender, subject, email content, headers, etc. The specific variables depend on how the dataset was prepared and annotated.

Target variable: The dataset typically includes a binary target variable indicating whether the email is spam (1) or non-spam (0). The goal is to build a predictive model capable of correctly classifying emails based on this target variable.

Data preprocessing: The dataset may require preprocessing before it can be used to train a spam detection model. Preprocessing steps may include removing special characters, converting to lowercase, tokenizing words, removing common words (stop words), lemmatization/stemming, etc.

Dataset size: The size of the dataset can vary depending on the total number of emails collected and annotated as spam or non-spam. Some datasets may be relatively small, while others may be larger in volume.
