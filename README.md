Predicting Customer Churn using Random Forest Classifier  
The goal of this project is to develop a predictive model that can identify customers who are likely to churn from a subscription-based service.
By analyzing historical customer data, including usage behavior and customer demographics, we can build a machine learning model that predicts churn,
allowing the business to take proactive measures to retain customers.

Dataset:
The dataset used for this project consists of historical customer data, including various features such as usage behavior (e.g., frequency of product usage,
duration of usage sessions) and customer demographics (e.g., age, gender, location). The dataset has been preprocessed and cleaned, 
ensuring the data is ready for model training and evaluation.

Model Selection:
For this prediction task, the RandomForestClassifier algorithm was chosen. RandomForestClassifier is an ensemble learning method that combines multiple 
decision trees to make predictions. It is particularly suitable for classification tasks and is known for its ability to handle complex relationships between features.
